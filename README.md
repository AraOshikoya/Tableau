#*Ara Oshikoya's Tableau Portfolio

Welcome to my Tableau portfolio. This code repository contains examples of Tableau I have worked on and the links to the interactive dashboards that I have created. Please feel free to take a look and reach out to me if you have any questions via my email: ara.oshikoya@gmail.com
---In this Tableau code, using the Tableau public, I worked on some questions on a database that holds Sample super store and Marketing data to answer some questions about the various data. --- The data is accessible to the public at https://techavilly.net/download-data/
